# Bike Sharing Assignment

> This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast the demand for shared bikes in the American market. BoomBikes, a leading bike-sharing provider, aims to leverage data insights to overcome challenges posed by the pandemic and better align with shifting customer needs.

By analyzing historical bike usage data, this project identifies key factors like weather, temperature, day of the week, and season that influence bike demand. Using linear regression, it explores how these variables affect demand fluctuations and helps predict future trends. 

The ultimate goal is to enable BoomBikes to:
- Optimize operations
- Adjust fleet distribution
- Refine pricing strategies
- Tailor marketing efforts

This data-driven approach will help BoomBikes anticipate demand, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve operational efficiency, positioning it as a leader in the competitive bike-sharing market during economic recovery.

## Conclusions

The following features significantly contribute to the prediction of bike demand (`cnt`):

### Top Features Influencing Bike Demand
1. **Temperature (`temp`)**  
   - A one-unit increase in `temp` leads to a **0.5044** increase in bike bookings.  
   - Warmer weather significantly drives bike demand.

2. **Year (`yr`)**  
   - A unit increase in `yr` (moving from 2018 to 2019) results in a **0.2328** increase in bike hirings.  
   - This indicates a rising trend in demand over time, showcasing business growth.

3. **Weather Condition (`snow/rain/thunderstorm`)**  
   - A unit increase in `snow/rain/thunderstorm` decreases bike bookings by **0.3004** units.  
   - Adverse weather conditions negatively impact bike demand.

### Additional Insights
- Factors such as **Sun**, **July**, **September**, **misty/cloudy**, **spring**, **summer**, and **winter** also influence bike demand but to a lesser extent.  
- Warmer temperatures and an increasing trend over the years are the primary positive drivers of demand, whereas adverse weather conditions significantly reduce bookings.
